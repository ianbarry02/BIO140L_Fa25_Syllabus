Alternatively, lab computers are available for your use. </span><span>Please read the lab handout thoroughly before each session.</span></p><p><span>&#xa0;</span></p><h2><span>Cell phone/Water bottle policy:</span></h2><p><span>Cell phone usage is not permitted in the BIO140 lab, unless specifically indicated by your lab instructor! </span><span>No exceptions!</span><span> Please place your cell phone in your backpack </span><span>before</span><span> entering the lab.</span><span> Water bottles must either be left in the hall outside the door or placed </span><span>inside</span><span> your backpack </span><span>before</span><span> entering the lab. </span></p><p><span>&#xa0;</span></p><p><span>According to the </span><a href="https://www.jmu.edu/biology/_files/chemical-hygiene-plan-june-2020.pdf"><span>JMU Biology Dept Chemical Hygiene Plan</span></a><span>, </span><span>(Section XVII. Standard Operation Procedures, Biology Lab Policies)</span><span> the following are not permitted in the lab: eating, drinking, chewing gum, smoking or vaping, and applying cosmetics (including lip balm).</span></p><p><span>&#xa0;</span></p><h2><a name="_heading_h.3kaqgfwwgx69"></a><span>Electronic Resources:</span></h2><p><span>The lab </span><span>Canvas website</span><span> will serve as my main communication resource for all aspects of the course. You will be responsible for checking it frequently for posted announcements (</span><span>A</span><span>nnouncements</span><span> tab), course assignments &amp; resources (</span><span>M</span><span>odules</span><span> tab), viewing/submitting assignments (</span><span>A</span><span>ssignments</span><span> tab), taking pre- and post-lab quizzes (</span><span>Q</span><span>uizzes</span><span> tab) and monitoring your grades (</span><span>G</span><span>rades</span><span> tab).</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>You will be responsible for all notifications posted via Canvas</span><span>,</span><span> so make sure your Canvas settings are adjusted appropriately</span><span>. To minimize confusion, please contact me via my e-mail</span><span> (</span><span>please find my email address on your lab section’s front Canvas page</span><span>)</span><span>, rather than via Canvas messaging, for any question</span><span>s</span><span> or comment</span><span>s</span><span> </span><span>about</span><span> to the course. </span></p><p><span>&#xa0;</span></p><h2><span>Adding/Dropping Classes:</span></h2><p><span>Students are responsible for registering for classes and for verifying their class schedules. Friday, </span><span>August 29</span><span>, </span><span>2025</span><span> is the deadline for adding a </span><span>fall</span><span> semester class without departmental permission and is also the last day to withdraw from a class without a ‘W’ grade. </span><span>Monday, October 20</span><span> is the last day to add a course with departmental permission</span><span>,</span><span> and </span><span>Tuesday, October 21,</span><span> is the last day to withdraw from a course. No student will be allowed to withdraw after</span><span> Tuesday, October 21</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>Should extenuating circumstances arise after this date, students may contact their instructor to determine if a WP (withdrawn passing) or WF (withdrawn failing) may be an option. Assignment of WP/WF is at the discretion of the instructor. </span></p><p><span>&#xa0;</span></p><h2><span>Academic Integrity:</span></h2><p><span>Students are expected to abide by the JMU Honor Code (see the Student Handbook or the JMU Honor Council website at </span><a href="http://www.jmu.edu/honor/code.html"><span>http://www.jmu.edu/honor/code.html</span></a><span>). </span></p><p><span>&#xa0;</span></p><h2><span>Generative Artificial Intelligence:</span></h2><p><span>It is expected that all work is produced by the students themselves, whether individually or collaboratively. Students must not seek the assistance of Generative AI Tools like ChatGPT, unless explicitly permitted to do so. Use of a Generative AI Tool to complete an assignment constitutes </span><span>academic dishonesty</span><span>. </span><span>Writing assignments will be screened for plagiarism during submission.</span></p><p><span>&#xa0;</span></p><h2><span>Disruptive Events</span><span>:</span></h2><h3><span>Laboratory Attendance:</span></h3><p><span>On-time attendance in lab is required</span><span>. All the labs will be carried out in small groups, so missing a lab will put you AND your group members at a serious disadvantage.</span></p><p><span>&#xa0;</span></p><h3><span>Respiratory and Intestinal Viruses including Norovirus and Covid:</span></h3><p><span>DO NOT come to lab if you are vomiting/have diarrhea and/or have a fever. You should be fever-free and/or intestinal symptom-free for 24 hours before returning to class. Please consider wearing a mask if you have an active cough. Contact your instructor right away and explain the circumstances, and they will work with you to make up any missed work.</span></p><p><span>&#xa0;</span></p><p><span>What do I do If I miss a Lab? If you must miss a lab due to a planned, </span><span>verifiable</span><span> reason, it must be cleared by </span><span>your lab instructor in advance</span><span>,</span><span> and you must </span><span>make arrangements</span><span> to work with your lab instructor on completing the missed material. Students are expected to make up any missed assignments or assessments</span><span> whether the </span><span>absence is excused </span><span>or unexcused</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span> Please note that</span><span>,</span><span> as specified in </span><a href="https://www.jmu.edu/academic-affairs/_documents/policies/aapolicy_16.pdf"><span>JMU Academic Affairs Policy #16</span></a><span>, accommodations will be made for court-imposed legal obligations, religious observances, active military service, and official University functions. In all cases documentation must be provided to the instructor within one week of the missed lab. If you are ill, please contact the instructor as soon as possible to devise a plan for making up the missed lab. It is not necessary that the instructor be informed of the nature of the illness or emergency. </span></p><p><span>&#xa0;</span></p><p><span>Please email your instructor if you are experiencing extenuating circumstances.</span><span> If you miss too much class time due to unexpected health-related or other circumstances, an incomplete or class withdrawal option can be considered depending on the situation. </span><span> See </span><span>Adding/Dropping </span><span>C</span><span>lasses</span><span> above for additional options. </span><span>For extended absences, students are urged to contact the </span><a href="https://www.jmu.edu/studentaffairs/departments/deanofstudents/extended-absences.shtml"><span>Office of the Dean of Students</span></a><span>.</span><span> </span></p><p><span>&#xa0;</span></p><p><span>Absences not approved by your instructor are considered </span><span>unexcused</span><span>. The </span><span>first unexcused lab absence</span><span> will result in a zero for the quiz and any other items due that day. A </span><span>second unexcused absence</span><span> will result in a 10% deduction from the semester lab course grade. A </span><span>third unexcused absence </span><span>will result in a zero for the semester lab course grade. </span><span>Tardiness</span><span> to lab is also not acceptable. If </span><span>you are</span><span> 20 minutes late to lab on three days, that will count as one unexcused absence. </span></p><p><span>&#xa0;</span></p><h3><span>Inclement Weather:</span></h3><p><span>If the university opens late due to a weather delay, labs may start at that opening time. If labs are canceled due to bad weather, they will be made up as early as possible in the </span><span>same</span><span> week, which may be on the Saturday immediately following the missed day. Announcements concerning canceled labs will be posted on Canvas</span><span>,</span><span> usually within 12 hours of the cancellation. </span><span>It is your responsibility</span><span> to make certain that you are receiving Canvas notifications.</span></p><p><span>&#xa0;</span></p><h3><span>Threatening or Disruptive Behavior:</span></h3><p><span>Students who demonstrate disruptive behavior in the classroom, whether in person or virtually, are subject to </span><a href="https://www.jmu.edu/academic-affairs/_documents/policies/aapolicy-12.pdf"><span>Academic Affairs Policy #12, Disruption of Class</span></a><span>. Disruptive behavior includes any inappropriate student behavior that a reasonable faculty member would view as interfering with the ability of instructors to teach and students to learn. While taking classes, students should conduct themselves in an appropriate manner and do their best to minimize distractions that might compromise the ability of themselves, other students, and the instructor to have a quality learning experience.</span></p><p><span>&#xa0;</span></p><h3><span>Sexual Discrimination &amp; Harassment (Title IX):</span></h3><p><span>The JMU Title IX Office is responsible for receiving and responding to reports of sexual misconduct and other discrimination </span><span>based on</span><span> sex or gender, such as sexual harassment, sexual assault, sexual exploitation, dating violence, domestic violence and stalking. If you have experienced sexual misconduct or have questions about sex or gender discrimination, contact the </span><a href="https://www.jmu.edu/inclusion/title-ix/index.shtml?jmu_redir=r_access-and-enrollment"><span>JMU Title IX Office</span></a><span>. </span></p><p><span>&#xa0;</span></p><h3><span>Discrimination, Harassment and Retaliation:</span></h3><p><span>JMU is committed to providing a learning environment and workplace free from discrimination and retaliation. If you have experienced harassment or discrimination, contact the </span><a href="https://www.jmu.edu/oeo/how-to-file-a-complaint/index.shtml"><span>Office of Equal Opportunity</span></a><span>. </span></p><p><span>&#xa0;</span></p><h3><span>Offensive Content Notification:</span></h3><p><span>During this course, students will be collecting samples for DNA barcoding. Typical samples include plants or </span><span>insects/invertebrates. If you prefer not to extract DNA from insects or invertebrates, please let me know so I can accommodate you.</span></p><p><span>&#xa0;</span></p><h2><span>Getting Help</span></h2><p><span>Please see </span><span>y</span><span>our </span><span>lab section’s </span><span>Canvas page for instructor contact information, lab day, and lab time.</span></p><p><span>&#xa0;</span></p><h3><span>Tips for success:</span></h3><p><span>1)</span><span> </span><span>Read the weekly Canvas Announcements!  2) </span><span>Print out and r</span><span>ead the lab manual and complete the Prelab Quizzes before coming to class!!  </span><span>Bring the hard copy of the lab with you to class. </span><span>3) Remember to answer embedded quiz questions in prelab video assignments.  4) If you can’t view images in prelab quizzes, </span><span>use Chrome instead of Safari</span><span>!  5) Students who attend SWAT (Scientific Writing Assistance Team) editing sessions for help with writing and exam review sessions earn higher grades on average than students who do not. You will be reminded of these session dates in lab and in Canvas. </span></p><p><span>&#xa0;</span></p><h3><span>Commitment to your well-being:</span></h3><p><a name="_heading_h.vz9mrlp5dwm0"></a><span>I am here to help and support you.
